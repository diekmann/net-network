# This rule checks the source ip of a packet to see if it's in the BADGUY list,
# and if so, the packet is silently dropped.
$IPT -A INPUT -p tcp -m recent --rcheck --name BADGUY -j DROP

# This rule first checks to see if a packet's source ip is in the SSH list,
# and if so, whether it's seen more than six NEW SYN packets within the last
# 45 seconds.  If so, the NEW SYN packets are sent to the PERMBLOCK chain.
$IPT -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --syn -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m recent \
  --rcheck --hitcount 6 --name SSH --seconds 45 -j PERMBLOCK

# This rule checks whether it's seen more than three NEW SYN packets within
# the last 30 seconds.  If so, the NEW SYN packets after the third (but less
# than the sixth) are rejected with a TCP RST packet.  This should close the 
# connection, so innocent attempts to create more than three NEW connections
# within thirty seconds won't keep sending packets and find themselves in a
# permanent ban list.
$IPT -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --syn -m conntrack --ctstate NEW \
  -m recent --update --hitcount 3 --name SSH --seconds 30 -j REJECT \
  --reject-with tcp-reset

# This rule places all incoming NEW SYN ssh attempts in the "SSH" list (well,
# obviously, the ones caught by the earlier rules won't see this rule)
$IPT -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --syn -m conntrack --ctstate NEW \
  -m recent --set --name SSH -j ACCEPT

# This rule takes everything that was sent here from the second rule above,
# sets the source address in the "BADGUY" list, and silently drops the
# packet.  If you're the curious type, you can add a LOG rule to see a 
# record of all packets getting sent to this chain:
# # $IPT -A PERMBLOCK -j LOG --log-prefix "SSH ATTACK:  "
$IPT -A PERMBLOCK -p tcp -m recent --set --name BADGUY -j DROP


# To summarize, this setup will allow three NEW SYN packets on port 22 from
# any given ip address.  After three packets within 30 seconds, that address 
# will have the connection closed by a TCP RST response, and after six packets
# within 45 seconds, the packets will be silently dropped and the sender's 
# ip address added to a permanent block list.
#
# Once a sender triggers the REJECT rule, they will be required to wait however
# many seconds are specified (30, in this example) to avoid resetting the 
# timer and being rejected again.  So long as NEW SYN packets are being sent, 
# these rules will keep rejecting them, incrementing the counter, and resetting
# the timer.
#
# Once a sender ip address is added to the "BADGUY" list, they will always be 
# dropped immediately per the first rule above.  However, bear in mind that 
# this is not *truly* a *permanent* ban list - the lists will be cleared by 
# a reboot or an iptables rules flush.
#
# This should go without saying, but I'm assuming that you have correct rules
# in place above these to ACCEPT packets in ESTABLISHED and RELATED states, 
# and that you place a rule to create the PERMBLOCK chain before you actually
# try to jump to that chain.
#
# Finally, see man iptables  /recent for more information.  You can add/remove
# addresses from the lists manually, and there's quite a bit more helpful
# information on the manual page.

ChangeLog:

20081231 - rworkman
  Updated to use "-m conntrack --ctstate" instead of "-m state --state"
  This should be a more thorough stateful check.
